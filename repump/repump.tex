\handin{Regular Pumping Exploration}{PUT YOUR NAME HERE}{PUT THE DATE HERE}

The Pumping Lemma says that ``if $L$ is regular then the big quantified formula below is true.''  Or more succinctly, $Regular(L) \rightarrow C$ where $C$ is:

\begin{center}\[
\begin{array}{r}
\exists p \in N :\\
\forall s \in L : \\
|s| \geq p \rightarrow \\
\exists x, y, z \in \Sigma^* : \\
s = xyz\ \land \\
|y| > 0\ \land \\
|xy| \leq p\ \land \\
\forall i \geq 0 : \\
xy^iz \in L
\end{array}\]
\end{center}

Proof by contradiction is accomplished by showing for language $L_{suspect}$ that the negation of C is true, i.e., that the following formula holds:

\begin{center}\[
\begin{array}{r}
\forall p \in N :\\
\exists s \in L_{suspect} : \\
|s| \geq p\ \land \\
\forall x, y, z \in \Sigma^* : \\
s \neq xyz\ \lor \\
|y| = 0\ \lor \\
|xy| > p\ \lor \\
\exists i \geq 0 : \\
xy^iz \notin L_{suspect}
\end{array}\]
\end{center}


{\bf1.46} Prove that the following languages are not regular. You may use the pumping lemma and the closure of the class of regular languages under union, intersection, and complement.\\
{\bf a.} $\{0^{n}1^{m}0^{n} | m,n \geq 0\}$\\
\subitem Let $s = 0^{p}1^{m}0^{p}$\\
$y \neq \epsilon$\\
$|xy| \leq p$ (y must contain a zero)\\
Let $i = 0 : 0^{n}1^{m}0^{p} \notin L_{suspect}$\\
$\therefore$ The language is not regular\\


{\bf b.} $\{0^{m}1^{n} | m \neq n\}$\\
{\bf c.} $\{w | w \in \{0,1\}^{*} $ is not a palindrome \} \\

{\bf 1.55} The pumping lemma says that every regular language has a pumping length $p$, such that every string in the language can be pumped if it has length $p$ or more. If $p$ is a pumping length for language $A$, so is any length $p' \geq p$. The {\bf {\em minimum pumping length}} for $A$ is the smallest $p$ that is a pumping length for $A$. For example, if $A = 01^{*}$, the minimum pumping length is 2. The reason is that the string $s=0$ is in $A$ and has length 1 yet $s$ cannot be pumped, but any string in $A$ of length 2 or more contains a $1$ and hence can be pumped by dividing $s$ so that $x=0, y = 1,$ and $z$ is the rest. For each of the following languages, give the minimum pumping length and justify your answer.
\\{\bf a.} $0001^{*}$
\\$p=4$
\\{\bf c.} $001 \union 0^{*}1^{*}$
\\$p=3$
\\{\bf g.} $1^{*}01^{*}01^{*}$
\\$p=2$
\\{\bf i.} $1011$
\\$p=4$
