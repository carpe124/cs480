\section{Algebraic Screw-up}
What follows is a semi-faithful recounting of a failed attempt to solve the problem algebraically.
\subsection{Initial assumptions}
These are some assumptions we made in our first attempt to solve the problem with algebra:
1. $f(2n) = f(n)$
2. $f(2n-1) = f(n) + 1$

(1) turns out to be true, because of the fractal nature of $f(n)$.
(2) is false, although assuming it to be true makes for some interesting algebra.
